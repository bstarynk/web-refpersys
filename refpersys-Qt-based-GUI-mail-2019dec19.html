    <p>Hello all (and notably Abhishek)<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Above all, <font color="red"><b>some discussion in written
          English to </b><b><tt><a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:team@refpersys.org">team@refpersys.org</a></tt></b><b> is
          needed before any implementation or coding effort.</b></font>
      Let me start it. Once we agreed on the detailed design, we can add
      a few paragraphs to <tt>refpersys-design.tex</tt> then code the
      interface using Qt5.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>First, the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://github.com/bstarynk/bismon/">bismon</a> GUI
      interface using GTK is a example of mistake to avoid. Just play
      with it to understand why. Or read the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/bismon-chariot-doc.pdf">draft
        report</a> (and feel free to ask questions in written English
      here on <tt><a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:team@refpersys.org">team@refpersys.org</a></tt> about it). I won't repeat in
      this email what I did write in English elsewhere.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Then, I would like all of us to first discuss how we would input
      the following rule. Assume that RefPerSys is able to load and dump
      a persistent state (that is quite easy, we are not far from that),
      in a way similar to Bismon. In other words, assume that our <a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://gitlab.com/bstarynk/refpersys/-/milestones/1">primordial
        persistence milestone #1</a> has been reached (we are not far
      from that, and I foresee no conceptual difficulty, since Bismon
      did it two years ago; it is just a matter of coding).</p>
    <p>Read again J.Pitrat's paper on <i>implementation of a reflexive
        system</i> (FGCS vol 16, 1996, cited in our ECAI submission). It
      is available (by <tt>ssh</tt>) on <tt>ours.starynkevitch.net</tt>
      as <tt>$HOME/biblio/reflective-system-pitrat:1996.pdf</tt><br>
    </p>
    <p>How would you input the example in its §2.1, second column of
      page 236?<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Refer also to Pitrat's paper <i>A Step toward an Artificial
        Artificial Intelligence Scientist </i>on <a

    <p>I would like RefPerSys to use the ∑ Unicode character  <tt>U+2211
        N-ARY SUMMATION</tt>  instead of SIGMA. We really want to use
      UTF-8 in 2020!</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Yet another example is basic arithmetic laws. We all know that <font
        color="purple"><b>∀ x ∈ ℤ, x² ≥ 0</b></font></p>
    <p>Notice that all this is Unicode characters (notably <tt>U+2200
        FOR ALL</tt>, <tt>U+2208 ELEMENT OF</tt>, <tt>U+2124
        DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Z</tt>, <tt>U+00B2 SUPERSCRIPT TWO</tt>,
      <tt>U+2265 GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO</tt>). I really want that
      formula to appear <i>exactly</i> like above on the screen (in
      CAIA, it used some ugly Fortran like syntax). Of course the purple
      color might be different, and I am not against using different
      colors for x (a variable) and for <font color="purple"><b>ℤ </b><font
          color="black">(a constant), both being reified as RefPerSys
          objects.</font><b><font color="black"> </font></b></font><b>How
        would we type</b> (that is enter with our hands) <b>that
        formula?</b> What concrete keypresses and mouse actions? Think
      of course of some abstract syntax tree representing it. Observe
      that neither Indian QWERTY keyboard or French AZERTY keyboard
      layout has a key for them - with a possible exception for <tt>U+00B2
        SUPERSCRIPT TWO </tt>which might be the top left key, if I
      configured my AZERTY keyboard correctly.<br>
      <tt></tt></p>
    <p>I don't even know yet today if we should use or subclass <a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtextdocument.html">QTextDocument</a>
      and <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtextedit.html">QTextEdit</a> (so
      use Qt <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/richtext.html">Rich Text Processing</a>)
      or use Qt <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/graphicsview.html">Graphics View
        Framework</a><br>
    </p>
    <p>We also should rapidly be able to input some documentation, à la
      wiki or markdown, mentioning objects by objids, and having at
      least bold, italics, teletype (some equivalent of <tt>&lt;b&gt;
        &lt;i&gt; &lt;tt&gt;</tt> in HTML) and some kind of internal
      hyperlink. The conceptual model but not the syntax nor the
      implementation of <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/">GNU texinfo</a>
      could be inspirational.</p>
    <p>I found very inspirational the old <i>Centaur</i> system from
      INRIA. Read this <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01531246/document"><i>Cokace: A
          Centaur-based environment forCommonKADS Conceptual Modelling
          Language</i></a> paper and this <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00075774/document">Centaur :
        the system</a> one.</p>
    <p>As software, Centaur is dead (it ran on computers and operating
      systems that do not exist anymore). But I had the privilege to
      discuss about Centaur with the late <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Kahn"><i>Gilles Kahn</i></a>
      when I was at INRIA. He was the head of INRIA, but still a very
      accessible guy. He was quite critical on his past achievement, but
      the impression I got from him was that Centaur (1990) failed
      because the computers were too slow (so many basic interactions
      took a second, which for a human being is a lot: we need any
      editor to react in less than a tenth of second for each elementary
      action like a keypress). Today, our computers are at least a
      hundred faster! So I guess we should be inspired by Centaur.</p>
    <p>I myself remembered the time (1990) when <tt>emacs</tt> was too
      slow. Today it is definitely fast enough (because computers are
      faster).</p>
    <p>I am waiting for your opinion (in particular, how do you think
      the input of <font color="purple"><b>∀ x ∈ ℤ, x² ≥ 0 </b></font>should
      happen, assume that we really want to see something similar on the
      screen). I am sometimes dreaming that we somehow type the <font
        color="purple"><b>≥</b></font><b> </b>and that triggers two
      empty colored boxes around it to be filled so<b> <font
          color="red">□</font> </b><font color="purple"><b>≥ </b></font><b><font
          color="red">□</font> </b>but the red boxes are <u>not</u>
      Utf8 characters but just blank areas (think of <tt>&lt;input&gt;</tt>
      in HTML5) where the keyboard focus can go.</p>
    <p>We need to design our GUI well enough. An intuition is that we
      should use the keyboard (so the function keys) because it is
      faster than the mouse (a human can type 10 keys per second, but
      only 3 mouse actions per second). We may also want some contextual
      menus (at least to explain us what function keys could be
      pressed).</p>
    <p><font color="red"><b>I am impatiently waiting for your comments.</b></font>
      You probably have more experience than I do (e.g. in Web interface
      design).</p>
    <p>Cheers<br>
